## Nodes

### Overview

Kroma is composed of 3 nodes: `proposer`, `validator` and `vanilla`.  The following are components that
are used to run each node:

| Node        | Components                                                                          |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `proposer`  | `L2 EL client` + `L2 CL client` + `kroma-batcher`                                   |
| `validator` | `L2 EL client` + `L2 CL client` + `kroma-validator` + (optionally `kroma-prover`)   |
| `vanilla`   | `L2 EL client` + `L2 CL client`                                                     |

`kroma-prover` is only needed when `kroma-validator` is turned on with `challenger` mode.

**NOTE:** Here `L2 EL client` means `kroma-geth` and `L2 CL client` means `kroma-node`. `L2 EL client` can
be expanded to other clients for pragmatic decentralization.

### Sequencer -> Proposer

We use `sequencing` for transaction inclusion, exclusion and ordering. Currently, `sequencer` does not only
this but also does block building. Thinking of Ethereum PoS, this is what `proposer` exactly does, which is building
and proposing a block. To take this into consideration, we rename the actor `sequencer` to `proposer` and plan to
separate block building ability from `proposer` in the future. We will make the results of our research public.

### Proposer -> Validator

For the same reason above, we use the term `validator` to represent an entity that submits
[L2 output root][g-l2-output-root]. Because this resembles how L1 validator casts FFG vote at every epoch.

## Geth

To prepare for migration to ZK Rollup, we use a [ZK Trie][g-zktrie] to represent state. Currently, this makes
the chain slower than [Merkle Patrica Trie][g-mpt]. As the bottleneck is the time to produce ZK proof right now,
we adopt it from [Scroll]. When we overcome the proof generation time problem, we will smoothly migrate state
without a hard fork or huge changes. Thus, you might face an unexpected result when retrieving JSON-RPC such as
`eth_getProof`.

Additionally, to produce a zkEVM proof, geth should return so called `execution trace` via JSON-RPC
`kroma_getBlockTraceByNumberOrHash` which provides zkEVM prover with data as a witness.

## Validator

### ZK fault proof

Instead of [cannon], Kroma uses zkEVM for [ZK fault proof][g-zk-fault-proof].
